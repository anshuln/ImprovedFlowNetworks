1. Finish baseline. 
	a) make a 3 layer network trained on cifar on NLL. 
	b) add non-linearity, additive coupling layer with relu. 
----DONE


# OPTIMIZATIONS 

2. FFT of real input is complex symmetric (see wiki on DFT). Make benchmarks. 


3. Maybe we can use this tf.rfft. 




4. DONT Get gradient checkpointing ;; https://github.com/openai/gradient-checkpointing
	(but use it to understand graph editor)
	and try to get constant depth memory
